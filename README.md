# Welcome to Smashing Fins Food Truck

## Using React Native with Expo and Tailwindcss we are able to create a fully customizable mobile app for a Food Truck. This project gives you the food trucks home screen, menu page, quick info page, and a search page coming soon. There are featured items on the home screen, which are the most popular main dishes people order. We have kept a clean look, and customized the background color for elegance. The loading Icon has been updated to show a custom image for the specific food truck.

## Routing Method: File-Basing Routing

- The file within the app, or tabs, folder is representing my route. The file name is the URL. i.e. "/menu" is the url route for the menu.tsx file
- I used both the Link and TabBars types for the navigation throughout my different routes.

## Challenge

- One challenge I faced was that my project was not compiling at first when the NativeWind TailwindCss installs were introduces.
- Once I was able to have my app compile, the Tailwindcss styles were not appearing. After extensive research and trial and errors I was able to have them work again.
- As you can see I am still working on getting icons in the tab bar to associate with each path it leads to
